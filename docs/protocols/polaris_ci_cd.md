# CI/CD Protocol: Project Genesis

## Core Principles
- **Automation First:** Automate all stages of the software delivery pipeline.
- **Fast Feedback:** Provide rapid feedback on code changes to developers.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensure builds and deployments are consistent and reproducible.
- **Continuous Delivery:** Aim for a state where code is always ready for production deployment.
- **Security Integration:** Embed security checks throughout the pipeline.

## Pipeline Stages
1. **Code Commit:**
   - Trigger: `git push` to `develop` or feature branches.
   - Actions: Linting, static code analysis (SAST), unit tests.
   - Quality Gate: Must pass all checks for PR merge.
2. **Build:**
   - Trigger: Merge to `develop` or `main`.
   - Actions: Compile code, build artifacts (e.g., Docker images).
   - Quality Gate: Successful build, artifact scanning.
3. **Test:**
   - Trigger: Successful build.
   - Actions: Integration tests, E2E tests, performance tests, DAST.
   - Quality Gate: All tests pass, performance within benchmarks.
4. **Deploy (to Staging):**
   - Trigger: Successful tests.
   - Actions: Deploy artifacts to a staging environment.
   - Quality Gate: Staging environment health checks, manual QA (if applicable).
5. **Deploy (to Production):**
   - Trigger: Manual approval after staging validation.
   - Actions: Deploy artifacts to production environment.
   - Quality Gate: Production health checks, smoke tests.

## Tools & Configuration
- **Version Control:** Git (GitHub/GitLab)
- **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions / GitLab CI
- **Container Registry:** Docker Hub / AWS ECR / GCP Container Registry
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform (managed by ARCHITECT agent)
- **Monitoring & Logging:** [e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack]

## Quality Gates
- **Code Quality:** Enforced by linting, static analysis, and code review.
- **Test Coverage:** Minimum thresholds for unit and integration tests.
- **Security Scans:** No critical or high vulnerabilities detected.
- **Performance:** Key metrics within defined thresholds.
- **Manual Approval:** Required for production deployments.

## Deployment Workflow
- **Automated Deployments:** Staging deployments are fully automated.
- **Blue/Green or Canary Deployments:** Preferred strategies for production to minimize downtime and risk.
- **Rollback Strategy:** Clearly defined and automated rollback procedures in case of issues.
