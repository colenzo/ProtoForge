# ADAPTATION LOOP

## Week of September 5, 2025
**Shipped:** Initial Project Genesis application structure created:
- `requirements.txt` with initial Python dependencies.
- `src/main.py` as the FastAPI entry point.
- `src/agents/`, `src/core/`, `src/api/`, `src/models/` subdirectories for code organization.
- Implemented natural language interface endpoint (`/genesis/idea`) in `src/api/genesis.py` and integrated into `src/main.py`.
- Created placeholder AI-driven code generation agent (`src/agents/code_generator.py`).
- Integrated code generation agent into `/genesis/idea` endpoint.
- Created placeholder automated testing agent (`src/agents/testing_agent.py`).
- Integrated testing agent into `/genesis/idea` endpoint, processing generated code.
- Defined `GenesisResponse` model (`src/models/genesis_response.py`) to combine code generation and testing results.
- Created placeholder automated deployment agent (`src/agents/deployment_agent.py`).
- Integrated deployment agent into `/genesis/idea` endpoint, processing generated code and test results.
- Introduced `src/core/orchestrator.py` to manage the multi-agent workflow.
- Refactored `/genesis/idea` endpoint to use the orchestrator for cleaner logic.
- Introduced `src/core/knowledge_logger.py` to simulate logging events to the Knowledge Vault.
- Integrated `knowledge_logger` into the orchestrator to log outcomes of code generation, testing, and deployment.
