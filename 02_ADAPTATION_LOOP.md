# ADAPTATION LOOP

## Week of September 5, 2025
**Shipped:** Initial Project Genesis application structure created:
- `requirements.txt` with initial Python dependencies.
- `src/main.py` as the FastAPI entry point.
- `src/agents/`, `src/core/`, `src/api/`, `src/models/` subdirectories for code organization.
- Implemented natural language interface endpoint (`/genesis/idea`) in `src/api/genesis.py` and integrated into `src/main.py`.
- Created placeholder AI-driven code generation agent (`src/agents/code_generator.py`).
- Integrated code generation agent into `/genesis/idea` endpoint.
- Created placeholder automated testing agent (`src/agents/testing_agent.py`).
- Integrated testing agent into `/genesis/idea` endpoint, processing generated code.
- Defined `GenesisResponse` model (`src/models/genesis_response.py`) to combine code generation and testing results.
- Created placeholder automated deployment agent (`src/agents/deployment_agent.py`).
- Integrated deployment agent into `/genesis/idea` endpoint, processing generated code and test results.
- Introduced `src/core/orchestrator.py` to manage the multi-agent workflow.
- Refactored `/genesis/idea` endpoint to use the orchestrator for cleaner logic.
- Introduced `src/core/knowledge_logger.py` to simulate logging events to the Knowledge Vault.
- Integrated `knowledge_logger` into the orchestrator to log outcomes of code generation, testing, and deployment.
- Created placeholder automated security agent (`src/agents/security_agent.py`).
- Integrated security agent into the orchestrator, performing scans after code generation.
- Created placeholder external service integration agent (`src/agents/integration_agent.py`).
- Integrated integration agent into the orchestrator, simulating connections to external services.
- Created placeholder Infrastructure as Code (IaC) generation agent (`src/agents/infrastructure_agent.py`).
- Integrated IaC generation agent into the orchestrator, performing generation after security scans.
- Introduced `src/core/nexus_manager.py` to simulate inter-protocol communication and conflict resolution.
- Integrated Nexus manager into the orchestrator, performing checks before each major agent call.
- Refined `src/agents/code_generator.py` to simulate varied outcomes (success, warnings, failure) and provide richer output.
- Implemented conditional logic in `src/core/orchestrator.py` to halt the process if code generation fails.
- Refined `src/agents/security_agent.py` to simulate varied outcomes (passed, warnings, failed) and provide richer output.
- Implemented conditional logic in `src/core/orchestrator.py` to halt the process if security scan fails.
- Refined `src/agents/infrastructure_agent.py` to simulate varied outcomes (success, warnings, failed) and provide richer output.
- Implemented conditional logic in `src/core/orchestrator.py` to halt the process if IaC generation fails.
- Refined `src/agents/testing_agent.py` to simulate varied outcomes (success, warnings, failed) and provide richer output.
- Implemented conditional logic in `src/core/orchestrator.py` to halt the process if testing fails.
- Refined `src/agents/deployment_agent.py` to simulate varied outcomes (success, warnings, failed) and provide richer output, considering test status.
- Implemented conditional logic in `src/core/orchestrator.py` to halt the process if deployment fails.
- Refined `src/agents/integration_agent.py` to simulate varied outcomes (success, warnings, failed) and provide richer output.
- Implemented conditional logic in `src/core/orchestrator.py` to handle integration results (last step).
- Refined `src/core/nexus_manager.py` to simulate varied outcomes (ok, conflict, waiting) and introduce delays.
- Enhanced `src/core/orchestrator.py` with a `_run_with_nexus_check` helper to manage Nexus checks, including conflict detection and simulated dependency waits.
- Refined `src/core/knowledge_logger.py` to include `log_level`, `source_agent`, and `log_id` for more structured logging.
- Updated `src/core/orchestrator.py` to utilize the enhanced `knowledge_logger` with detailed event logging.
- Enhanced `src/agents/code_generator.py` to generate different types of code (e.g., Flask, Pandas, simple scripts) based on input idea keywords, and to dynamically generate file structures and dependencies.
- Enhanced `src/agents/testing_agent.py` to include `file_structure` and `dependencies` in its input, and to simulate more relevant test results based on code type.
- Updated `src/core/orchestrator.py` to pass `file_structure` and `dependencies` to the `testing_agent`.
- Enhanced `src/agents/deployment_agent.py` to include `file_structure`, `dependencies`, and `infrastructure_results` in its input, and to simulate more relevant deployment outcomes.
- Updated `src/core/orchestrator.py` to pass `file_structure`, `dependencies`, and `infrastructure_results` to the `deployment_agent`.
- Enhanced `src/agents/integration_agent.py` to include `file_structure`, `dependencies`, and `deployment_results` in its input, and to simulate more relevant integration outcomes.
- Updated `src/core/orchestrator.py` to pass `file_structure`, `dependencies`, and `deployment_results` to the `integration_agent`.
- Enhanced `src/core/nexus_manager.py` to simulate resource contention, include a basic retry mechanism for dependencies, and refine conflict detection.
- Updated `src/core/orchestrator.py` to utilize the enhanced `nexus_manager` and log Nexus check results with detailed parameters.
